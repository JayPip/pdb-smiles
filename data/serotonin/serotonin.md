name = "serotonin"

description = """A biochemical messenger and regulator, synthesized from the
essential amino acid L-TRYPTOPHAN. In humans it is found primarily in
the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and blood
platelets. Serotonin mediates several important physiological
functions including neurotransmission, gastrointestinal motility,
hemostasis, and cardiovascular integrity. Multiple receptor families
(RECEPTORS, SEROTONIN) explain the broad physiological actions and
distribution of this biochemical mediator."""
